<!-- 
Implement a solution for fetching and displaying the data. The requirements are as follows:
Assume that the names of the files data1.json and data2.json are not known in advance (you could even use a bash/PowerShell script to randomly modify the names to something unexpected!).
The names of the files reference.json and data3.json are known.
All the data from the three files need to be fetched and processed. 
The processing needs to be performed on the data from each file separately, as soon as they are fetched. 
Then the data need to be stiched together in the right order (data1, data2, data3) and displayed in a table.
The processing should produce entries with separate name and surname and id (three properties in all).
Repeat the implementation three times using the following approaches:
XMLHttpRequest used synchronously
XMLHttpRequest used asynchronously with callbacks
fetch() and promises
The HTML page should have three different buttons, with clicks on each of them invoking one of the implementations.
Once you are happy that your implementations are working on the local test server, 
push your files to the GitHub Pages-enabled repository and test them by accessing the HTML page from there.
